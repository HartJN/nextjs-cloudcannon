Welcome to Space Jelly, the go-to website for web development tutorials and resources! Our site is dedicated to helping developers learn how to build modern, dynamic websites using the JAMstack architecture and CloudCannon as a content management system (CMS).

Our mission is to provide you with the knowledge and tools you need to create fast, secure, and scalable websites that can be easily maintained and updated. Whether you're a seasoned developer looking to expand your skills or a newcomer to the world of web development, our tutorials and resources will help you achieve your goals.

At Space Jelly, we believe in the power of JAMstack, which stands for JavaScript, APIs, and Markup. This architecture enables us to create websites that are fast, secure, and scalable, with better performance and user experience than traditional web development approaches. We'll show you how to leverage JAMstack and the power of modern web technologies to build sites that can handle high traffic and complex functionality.

We also believe in the power of CloudCannon as a CMS. With CloudCannon, you can create dynamic content and manage your site's content without the need for complex backend infrastructure. Our tutorials will show you how to use CloudCannon to create custom templates, manage content, and deploy your site with ease.

Our team of experienced web developers and designers creates all of our tutorials and resources. We've built websites for a variety of industries and niches, from small business sites to large e-commerce platforms. We're passionate about sharing our knowledge and helping others succeed in web development.

Thank you for visiting Space Jelly! We hope you find our tutorials and resources helpful and informative. Be sure to check back often for new content and updates.
